Quiz finished! You scored 1/5 (20%).

Here's a review of the questions you missed:
For question: "Which of the following is NOT a core principle of OOP?"
The correct answer was: Compilation.
Explanation: While compilation is part of the code execution process, it is not one of the foundational principles of Object-Oriented Programming. The core ideas of OOP revolve around modeling real-world entities through classes and objects, allowing features like code reuse, dynamic behavior, and secure data handling.

For question: "What is a class in OOP?"
The correct answer was: A blueprint for creating objects.
Explanation: In Object-Oriented Programming, a class is a template or blueprint that defines the properties and methods that objects of that class will possess. It serves as a reusable structure from which multiple instances (objects) can be created, each having its own state but sharing the same functionality defined by the class.

For question: "What is an object in OOP?"
The correct answer was: An instance of a class.
Explanation: An object is a basic unit of OOP representing an instance of a class. It contains real values for the attributes defined in the class and can execute the methods associated with that class. For example, if 'Car' is a class, then 'myCar' could be an object of that class with specific details like color, model, and speed.

For question: "What does inheritance allow in OOP?"
The correct answer was: One class to inherit properties and methods from another.
Explanation: Inheritance allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass). This feature enables developers to build upon existing functionality without rewriting code, promoting modular and scalable designs.

Here's a review of the questions you missed:
For question: "What is a key feature of Scala?"
The correct answer was: Static typing.
Explanation: Scala's static typing system provides strong guarantees about the types of values at compile time, reducing runtime errors. It also supports type inference, which allows developers to omit explicit type annotations in many cases.

For question: "What is the purpose of the 'val' keyword in Scala?"
The correct answer was: To declare an immutable variable.
Explanation: In Scala, 'val' is used to define variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned. This immutability helps prevent unintended side effects and enhances thread safety in concurrent programs.

For question: "What is a common use case for Scala?"
The correct answer was: Big data processing with Spark.
Explanation: Scala is the primary language for Apache Spark, a powerful framework for distributed data processing. Its functional programming capabilities make it well-suited for handling large datasets efficiently.

For question: "What does Scala's 'case class' provide?"
The correct answer was: Automatic boilerplate code.
Explanation: Scala's case classes automatically generate useful methods such as equals, hashCode, toString, and copy. They are particularly useful for creating immutable data structures and pattern matching.

Quiz finished! You scored 1/5 (20%).

Here's a review of the questions you missed:
For question: "Which of the following is NOT a core principle of OOP?"
The correct answer was: Compilation.
Explanation: While compilation is part of the code execution process, it is not one of the foundational principles of Object-Oriented Programming. The core ideas of OOP revolve around modeling real-world entities through classes and objects, allowing features like code reuse, dynamic behavior, and secure data handling.

For question: "What is a class in OOP?"
The correct answer was: A blueprint for creating objects.
Explanation: In Object-Oriented Programming, a class is a template or blueprint that defines the properties and methods that objects of that class will possess. It serves as a reusable structure from which multiple instances (objects) can be created, each having its own state but sharing the same functionality defined by the class.

For question: "What is an object in OOP?"
The correct answer was: An instance of a class.
Explanation: An object is a basic unit of OOP representing an instance of a class. It contains real values for the attributes defined in the class and can execute the methods associated with that class. For example, if 'Car' is a class, then 'myCar' could be an object of that class with specific details like color, model, and speed.

For question: "What does inheritance allow in OOP?"
The correct answer was: One class to inherit properties and methods from another.
Explanation: Inheritance allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass). This feature enables developers to build upon existing functionality without rewriting code, promoting modular and scalable designs.

The correct answer was: def.
Explanation: In Python, the `def` keyword is used to define a function. After `def`, you specify the function name followed by parentheses containing any parameters.

For question: "What is the purpose of `self` in Python classes?"
The correct answer was: To refer to the current instance of the class.
Explanation: In Python, `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class. It must be the first parameter of any instance method and is used to access or modify the instance's attributes.

For question: "Which of the following data types is mutable?"
The correct answer was: list.
Explanation: Python lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified after they are created. Tuples, strings, and integers are immutable, so their values cannot be changed once assigned.

Here's a review of the questions you missed:
For question: "What is a primary goal of studying DSA?"
The correct answer was: Optimizing problem-solving efficiency.
Explanation: The main purpose of studying Data Structures and Algorithms is to learn how to solve problems more efficiently by selecting the right data structure and algorithm for the task. This ensures that programs run faster and use memory optimally, which is crucial in real-world applications and technical interviews.

For question: "What does DSA stand for?"
The correct answer was: Data Structures and Algorithms.
Explanation: DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms. It refers to the study of how data is organized (data structures) and the methods or processes used to solve computational problems efficiently (algorithms). Mastery of DSA is essential for software development, competitive programming, and understanding system design at a deeper level.

For question: "Which of the following is a disadvantage of a linked list compared to an array?"
The correct answer was: No random access.
Explanation: Unlike arrays, linked lists require sequential access, meaning you must traverse from the head to reach a specific node. This results in slower access times (O(n)), although linked lists excel in dynamic insertions and deletions.

For question: "Which of the following is a dynamic programming technique?"
The correct answer was: Memoization.
Explanation: Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems. Memoization is a key technique used to cache results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again, drastically improving efficiency in recursive and iterative solutions.

For question: "What is a heap primarily used for?"
The correct answer was: Efficient retrieval of minimum or maximum elements.
Explanation: Heaps are complete binary trees that satisfy the heap property, allowing efficient access to the largest or smallest element. They are the foundation for priority queues and are used in algorithms like Heap Sort and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for efficient node selection.

Quiz finished! You scored 1/5 (20%).

Here's a review of the questions you missed:
For question: "What is the space complexity of a hash table?"
The correct answer was: O(n).
Explanation: A hash table stores key-value pairs and uses a hashing function to map keys to indices. Since each entry consumes memory, the space complexity of a hash table is O(n), where n is the number of elements. While lookups and insertions are typically O(1), space considerations are important for scalability.

For question: "What is a linked list used for in DSA?"
The correct answer was: Dynamic memory allocation.
Explanation: Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes that point to the next node. They allow dynamic resizing and efficient insertion and deletion operations, making them suitable for situations where the size of the dataset changes frequently.

For question: "What is the advantage of using a heap over a simple array for retrieving the largest element?"
The correct answer was: O(1) access to max//min element.
Explanation: In a max-heap, the root always contains the largest element, and in a min-heap, the smallest. This allows for immediate retrieval of the maximum or minimum value, which is particularly useful in scheduling, statistics, and priority-based systems.

For question: "Which of the following is a dynamic programming technique?"
The correct answer was: Memoization.
Explanation: Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems. Memoization is a key technique used to cache results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again, drastically improving efficiency in recursive and iterative solutions.
